# Challenge Cup Simulator

A Pokémon Stadium 2 challenge cup team generator that emulates the in-game one.

Recently I figured out how Pokémon Stadium 2 generates random teams for the
Challenge Cup mode. I decided to replicate the exact way it generates the team
from the RNG to check that my understanding was correct, and that's what this
project is. With that check done, I've written a
[blog post](https://genericmadscientist.github.io/posts/challenge-cup/) on how
it works.
