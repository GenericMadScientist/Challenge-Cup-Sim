# Challenge Cup Simulator

A Pokémon Stadium 2 challenge cup team generator that emulates the in-game one.

Recently I figured out how Pokémon Stadium 2 generates random teams for the
Challenge Cup mode. I decided to replicate the exact way it generates the team
from the RNG to check that my understanding was correct, and that's what this
project is. I'll be writing a blog post on how it works soon.
